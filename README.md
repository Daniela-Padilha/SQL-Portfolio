# SQL-Portfolio
This is my first repository ever, and I'll be adding projects to it as I learn and develop my SQL skills.
I will include exercises from multiple learning platforms, like Khan Academy and HackeRrank.
Exercises from my Business Intelligence Course.
As well as some projects developed by me.
