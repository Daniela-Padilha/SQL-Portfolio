# SQL-Portfolio
This is my first repository ever, and I'll be adding projects to it as I learn and develop my SQL skills.
I will include exercises from multiple learning platforms, like Khan Academy and HackeRrank.
Exercises from my Business Intelligence Course.
As well as some projects developed by me.

Please note that Khan Academy and HackeRrank where the very first exercises I ever did in SQL.
