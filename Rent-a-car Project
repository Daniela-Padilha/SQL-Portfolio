/* Project about analysing the rentals of a rent-a-car , using a database created by me.
The database consists of 3 tables that are structured like so:

CREATE TABLE Cars (
    Id            INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Manufacturer  TEXT (30),
    Model         TEXT (30),
    Category      TEXT (30),
    Gear_box_type TEXT (20),
    Fuel_type     TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Costumers (
    Id        INTEGER    PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    FirstName TEXT (20),
    LastName  TEXT (20),
    Gender    TEXT,
    Age       INTEGER,
    Email     TEXT (100) 
);

CREATE TABLE Rentals (
    Id          INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Costumer_id INTEGER,
    Car_id      INTEGER,
    Start_date  NUMERIC (10),
    End_date    NUMERIC (10),
    Price       REAL
);

/*Which was the most expensive rental?*/

SELECT Id,
       firstname,
       lastname,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       start_date,
       end_date,
       max(price) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id 
       JOIN
       costumers ON rentals.Costumer_id = costumers.Id
       
/*Which was the cheapest rental?*/

SELECT Id,
       firstname,
       lastname,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       start_date,
       end_date,
       min(price) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id 
       JOIN
       costumers ON rentals.Costumer_id = costumers.Id


/*Which was the most requested car*/

SELECT Id,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       count(model) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id
 GROUP BY model
 ORDER BY count(model) DESC
 LIMIT 1;
