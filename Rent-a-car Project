/* Project about analysing the rentals of a rent-a-car , using a database created by me.
The database consists of 3 tables that are structured like so:

CREATE TABLE Cars (
    Id            INTEGER   PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Manufacturer  TEXT (30),
    Model         TEXT (30),
    Category      TEXT (30),
    Gear_box_type TEXT (20),
    Fuel_type     TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Costumers (
    Id        INTEGER    PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    FirstName TEXT (20),
    LastName  TEXT (20),
    Gender    TEXT,
    Age       INTEGER,
    Email     TEXT (100) 
);

CREATE TABLE Rentals (
    Id          INTEGER      PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    Costumer_id INTEGER,
    Car_id      INTEGER,
    Start_date  NUMERIC (10),
    End_date    NUMERIC (10),
    Price       REAL
);

/*Which was the most expensive rental?*/

SELECT Id,
       firstname,
       lastname,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       start_date,
       end_date,
       max(price) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id 
       JOIN
       costumers ON rentals.Costumer_id = costumers.Id
       
/*Which was the cheapest rental?*/

SELECT Id,

       lastname,
       manufacturer,

       end_date,
       min(price) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id 
       JOIN
       costumers ON rentals.Costumer_id = costumers.Id


/*Which was the most requested car*/

SELECT Id,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       count(model) 
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
       cars ON rentals.Car_id = cars.Id
 GROUP BY model

 LIMIT 1;
 
 /*Which is the company most frequent costumer?*/
 
SELECT DISTINCT costumers.Id,
                count(firstname),
                lastname
  FROM costumers
       JOIN
       rentals ON costumers.Id = rentals.Costumer_id
 GROUP BY firstname
 ORDER BY count(firstname) DESC;
;

/*What would be the forecast of the company for next year, if the inflaction was 0,05%?*/

SELECT sum(price),
       sum(price) + (sum(price) * 0.005) AS forecast
  FROM rentals;
  
/*Classifying car models by price/* 

SELECT Id,
       manufacturer,
       model,
       sum(price),
       CASE WHEN sum(price) > 2000 THEN 'Expensive' WHEN sum(price) BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000 THEN 'Average' ELSE 'Cheap' END AS Price_range
  FROM rentals
       JOIN
