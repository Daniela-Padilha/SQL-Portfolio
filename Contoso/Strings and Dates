/*2. The StyleName column of the DimProduct table has some codes identified by distinct numbers, ranging from 0 to 9.
However, the control sector decided to change the identification of the StyleName, and instead of using numbers, the idea is now to start using letters to replace the numbers, as shown in the example below: 0->A, 1->B, 2->C, 3->D, 4->E, 5->F, 6->G, 7->H, 8->I, 9->J
It is your responsibility to change the numbers by letters in the StyleName column of the DimProduct table.*/

/*3. IT is creating a system for individual tracking of each employee in the Contoso company. Each employee will be assigned a login and password. Each employee's login will be the email ID. The password will be the FirtName + the day of the year the employee was born, in UPPERCASE. For example, an employee with E-mail: mark0@contoso.com and date of birth 15/01/1990 must have the following login: Login: mark0 Password: MARK15

/*5. The DimEmployee table has a hire date information. The HR area, however, needs the information of these dates separately in day, month and year, as an automation will be made to create an HR report, and it would be much easier if this information were separated in a table.
You should return a table containing the following information: FirstName, EmailAddress, HireDate, as well as the Day, Month, and Year columns of hiring. 
Note: The Month column must contain the name of the month, not the number of the month.*/
